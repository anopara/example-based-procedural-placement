# Example-based Procedural Placement
A.Opara & T.Stachowiak @ Embark Studios

Example-based Procedural Placement is an algorithm that automatically extracts placement rules from example arrangements. We introduced a novel similarity metric for object arrangements formulated via optimal transport and wasserstein distance to allow isotropic consistency between example and synthesized placements. The algorithm was a part of our experimental project Kittiwake, where we set out to explore a feeling of co-creation with a procedural system. We embodied the example-based placement algorithm into a little creature, whom we named Kittus. Kittus tries to assist you by mimicking your placements; it analyzes the neighborhoods of objects you place, and finds similar-looking locations in the level.
