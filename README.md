Example-based Procedural Placement algorithm automatically extracts placement rules from example arrangements. With a new similarity metric for object arrangements formulated via optimal transport and wasserstein distance, we show that we can achieve isotropic consistency between example and synthesized placements. The algorithm was a part of our experimental project Kittiwake at Embark Studios, where we set out to explore a feeling of co-creation with a procedural system. We embodied the example-based placement algorithm into a little creature, whom we named Kittus. Kittus tries to assist you by mimicking your placements; it analyzes the neighborhoods of objects you place, and finds similar-looking locations in the level.
