# Example-based Procedural Placement
[A.Opara](https://www.anastasiaopara.com/) & [T.Stachowiak](http://h3.gd/) @ [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/)

Example-based Procedural Placement algorithm automatically extracts placement rules from example arrangements. With a new similarity metric for object arrangements formulated via optimal transport and wasserstein distance, we show that we can capture anisotropic information present in an example in our synthesized placements. The algorithm was a part of our experimental project Kittiwake at Embark Studios, where we set out to explore a feeling of co-creation with a procedural system. We embodied the example-based placement algorithm into a little creature, whom we named Kittus. Kittus tries to assist you by mimicking your placements; it analyzes the neighborhoods of objects you place, and finds similar-looking locations in the level.
